INTRODUCTION
------------

This is my first project using Springboot's framework, a very powerful and intuitive tool that makes backend developing much more lightweight. 

It is focused on recreating a To-Do app, using Swagger for the UI and H2 for database inquiries.

Here are some screenshots of the final result:
